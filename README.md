## üìå Projects

### 1. Duplicate File Cleaner & Log Automation

* Developed a Python-based automation script to detect and delete duplicate files from a directory.
* **Checksum-based detection** using `hashlib (MD5)` to ensure accurate duplicate identification.
* **Automated log generation** with timestamps for file operations.
* **Email automation** using `smtplib` to send log reports directly to users.
* Supports **periodic execution** with the `schedule` library for continuous monitoring.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OS module, Hashlib, Schedule, smtplib

### 2. System Process Logger with Scheduling

* Designed to **periodically log running system processes**, including PID, process name, user, and memory usage.
* Utilized `psutil` for process scanning and monitoring.
* Automated creation of log files with **timestamps**.
* Scheduling support for **periodic logging** using the `schedule` library.
* Enhanced usability with options for **custom folder names and intervals**.

**Tech Stack:** Python, psutil, OS, Schedule, Time
